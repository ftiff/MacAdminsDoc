## Contributing
We welcome everyone interested in sharing to the MacAdmin community at large. 

### Getting Started
If you're new to the MacAdmin community, please read the doc [Getting Started](getting-started.md).

### Best practices?

We may need to find a better name. This site is about things that have a large consensus in the MacAdmin Community. For example: 

- thin imaging is better than thick imaging (not always).
- Apple maintains only the last three major OS releases (well… we had a security update for 10.6.8 after 10.11 was released[^slsecupdate]).

[^slsecupdate]: https://support.apple.com/kb/HT205267

So yes, defining "best practice" is not that easy. Think of what you will tell to your apprentice.

### What is a good doc?

A good documentation:

- **uses International English** - Keep the sentences clear, simple and straight to the point;
- **is neutral** - Show multiple point-of-views. Be accurate by citing reliable and authoritative sources. Debate is welcomed, but only on Issues and Pull Requests;
- **uses Free content** - As per the [license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), no one owns the content;
- **is respectful** - Follows the [Contributor Code of Conduct v1.3.0](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/3/0/).
- **is honest, but positive**.


### Contributing docs
We use [Github](https://github.com/Shufflepuck/MacAdminsDoc) to manage the whole content. You should be familiar with [how to contribute on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/). 
I personally use [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com) to edit the [MarkDown](https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown/wiki/MultiMarkdown-Syntax-Guide) documents.

There's two ways to contribute:

1. **Create an Issue** - If you find an error you don't know how to fix, please create an issue (checkout the [Issues Guide](http://guides.github.com/features/issues)).
2. **Pull Request** - If you're able to make the change directly, great! Fork, branch, document and open a pull request.
